This repo contains materials for the talk that I'm giving for [UNM - ISMART](https://www.instagram.com/ismartunm) on 4/23/2021.

## Legal Stuff
I am not speaking on behalf of my employer (or any previous employers), nor am I here representing any of my current or previous employers. My opinions do not reflect those of my current or previous employers and are solely my own.

There are techniques that we'll be covering in this talk that you could use to do bad things to sites and systems that don't belong to you. Don't do it. There are so many legit ways to learn how to hack these days and so many intentionally vulnerable exercises and sites that are made specifically for you to break.

## What is this talk about?
I wanted to take this opportunity to share some skills with you all that are exceptionally useful in the real world, that you probably aren't going to learn in school. I also want to provide you with some information that could help you get started doing something called "Bug Bounty Hunting." Bug Bounty Hunting is a wonderful industry that will allow you to grow as a security professional, choose your hours, not have to go into an office, and potentially make some money.

Because we only have 45 minutes and a ton to cover, we are going to touch on several topics, but not go into to deeply into any one topic. That means that there will probably be a lot of things that won't fully make sense at first. That's the purpose of this repository, to enable you to go back and build on the things that we talked about - this is a starting point.

## Something isn't working! Help me!
If there's anything that isn't clear or isn't working, please feel free to use the power of [Google](https://google.com) to help you find a solution. If you're really, really stuck and have exhausted all possible avenues that the Internet has provided you with, feel free to [Create an Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) in this repo. Maybe you'll get lucky and someone (probably not the author, they're very busy) will be able to respond with something helpful - especially if you provide enough information about the problem. Here's a great resource that you can use to get a sense of what you should include in an issue: https://guides.github.com/features/issues/.

If you find an issue in this repo and can fix it, please feel free to [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request#creating-a-pull-request) with your fix. This is a great way to learn how to get started contributing to an open-source project, which can, in turn, help you to grow as a professional and have something that stands out on your resume.
