# Bug Bounty Hunting

If you've been enjoying all the stuff we've done so far, know that you can get paid to do this whenever you want. No joke.

Bug Bounty Hunting is a relatively new industry. Several platforms exist to facilitate bug bounty hunting - the most popular are [hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/) and [bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/). These platforms give an organization the means to create public or private programs for their web apps, products, mobile apps, etc. Bug Bounty Hunters (bbh) on the platform can join these programs and hunt for vulnerabilities in any of the targets that are listed as part of the program's "scope." If a bbh can find a vulnerability, they report the vulnerability to the organization through the platform and wait to hear back on the finding. If the finding is valid, they will get awarded points on the bug bounty hunting platform, and potentially money.

Verizon Media has one of the biggest programs out there, feel free to check it out [here](https://hackerone.com/verizonmedia?type=team). As you can see, critical vulnerabilities can pay anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 per. You can also click the **Hacktivity** tab to see what other folks participating in the program have submitted. Most of these are not disclosed, but by selecting the dropdown with the word **All** on it, you can click **Disclosed** and read through a bunch of valid findings.

Protip: This is a great way to get better. Read what other people do and learn from their techniques.

Some companies have their own bug bounty programs, such as [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/), and several others.

## Why should I consider becoming a BBH?
1. It allows you to build a ton of great skills. If you're not ready to apply for an internship yet, this is something that you can do to build up your abilities that you will be shopping around to potential employers once you're done with school (or for an internship).
2. It can be a way to make some decent side money if you get good enough. Hell, there are even some hackers that [have made over a million dollars](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/hacker-earns-2m-in-bug-bounties/) just doing bug bounty hunting. Keep in mind these folks are very, very good, and it probably took them a lot of years of experience to get to that point.
3. You get to choose when you do bug bounty hunting, and who you do it for. This is great if you're a full-time student that needs some extra money.
